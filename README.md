1. Clone this repository wherever you want. I don't care. I clone it under ~/kicad on Linux or Documents/Kicad on Windows.

2. In Kicad (Project viewer) go to Preferences -> Configure Paths...

3. Create an entry for "FRANK_SYMBOL_DIR" and "FRANK_FP_DIR" and point them at the respective
   folders in this repository.

4. Done. Fetch and pull from this repository periodically to stay up to date.
